     KARMAYOGA_MOREINFO :  `The word “Kharma” means “to do, or to act”. Any mental or physical act is called Kharma. Kharma is also the word used to describe the consequence of this act, thus the word also refers to the Universal Law of Cause and Effect. Everything we do, say or think, gives rise to an effect, which in due time will return to us, in full accordance with this law of consequence. What we call “luck” is the result of our earlier good actions, and what appears to us as misfortune is merely the repercussion of past negative actions. Therefore, the events of our future do not arise coincidentally, but are actually caused by the effects of our previous and present actions. In this way our destiny is predetermined by our Kharma. Just as the destination of an arrow released from its bow is fixed and predictable, unless its course is diverted, or corrected by another event. We can lessen and alter the outcome of our Kharmas and gradually guide our destiny towards the positive by practicing “Yoga" in Daily Life, provides positive thinking, wisdom and selflessness. Our present situation is a result of our past deeds and our present actions will determine our future. Once we understand this, we can no longer blame anybody else for what happens to us, but rather accept responsibility for ourselves. There are two types of Kharmas, one is Sakama Kharma, which means selfish actions and another one is Nishkama Kharma, which means selfless actions. Selfish thoughts and actions deepen the duality between “mine” and “yours”. Being selfless however, leads us above and beyond the limit of our little ego, to the unity of all beings. Sakama Kharma binds us to Chorasi ka Chakra, which means the Wheel of Death and Rebirth. Nishkama Kharma frees us from this. It is the way to avoid creating new Kharma and may even resolve earlier Karma. To offer understanding, forgiveness and help are the selfless actions that liberate us from the cycle of Kharma.`,
     
     BHAKTHIYOGA_MOREINFO :`Bhakti means love and devotion to the God, love and devotion to his Creation, with respect and care for all living beings and all of nature. Everybody can practice Bhakti Yoga, whether young, old, rich or poor, no matter to what nation or religion one belongs. The path of Bhakti Yoga leads us safely and directly to the goal. Bhakti Yoga also includes the worship of a form of God. God is everywhere. God dwells within us and all around us. It is as though we are connected to God by a fine thread, that is, the thread of love. God is Universal love. Love and Divine Grace surround us and flow through us, but we are not conscious of this. The moment this consciousness, this Divine love, has been experienced, one never desires anything more. We then know the meaning of true love for God. A person lacking Bhakti is like a fish without water, a bird without wings, a night without the moon and stars. All beings need love. Through it we feel protected and happy just like a child in the arms of its mother or a traveller at the end of a long, arduous journey. There are two types of Bhakti, one is Apara Bhakti, which mean egoistic love and another one is Para Bhakti which means Universal love. A Bhakta accepts everything that happens to him as a gift of God. There is no desire or expectation, there is simply complete surrender to the will of God. This Bhakta accepts each life situation as placed before him by destiny. There is no resentment, his only Prayer is, “Let Thy will be done”. However, prior to reaching this level of supreme love for God, our Bhakti is intermingled with egoistic thoughts. This means that we do in fact love God, but also expect something from God. Many people turn to God for help when they are troubled or in pain. Others pray for material objects, money, glory, career promotion, etc. Yet we should always be mindful that when we depart from this earth, we must leave behind all possessions and that is why nothing here has any real or lasting value. Spiritual seekers pray for wisdom and God Realisation. However, often we create an inner picture of God, what God is like from our point of view, how God should act - and because of this, we are not open and ready for a Divine revelation. In the Bhakti Sutras, Sage Narada describes nine elements of Bhakti Yoga: Satsang, which means good spiritual company. Hari Katha, which means to hear and read about God. Shraddha, which means Faith. Ishvara Bhajana, which means to sing the praises of God. Mantra Japa, which means Repetition of God's name. Shama Dama, which means withdrawal and control of the senses with regard to worldly things. Santho kaa Adhar, which means to show honour to people who have dedicated their lives to God Santosha, which means Contentment, Ishvara Pranidhana, which means Devotion to God.`,
     
     RAJAYOGA_MOREINFO :   `Raja means King. A king acts with independence, self-confidence and assurance. Likewise, a Raja Yogi is autonomous, independent and fearless. Raja Yoga is the path of self-discipline and practice. Raja yoga as being the ultimate goal of yoga practice,rather than the physical and mental exercises involved. This means that it is considered the state of peace and contentment that comes with sustained yoga practice and meditation. Raja Yoga is also known as Ashtanga Yoga which means "eight limbs". In Ashtanga. ashta. means eight. anga. means limb. together called as "Ashtanga". These ashtangas are Yama. Niyama. Asana. Pranayam. Pratyahara. Dharana. Dhyana. Samadhi. These eight steps basically act as guidelines on how to live a meaningful and purposeful life. The first limb of Raja yoga or Ashtanga is Yama. which means Self-control. This yamas comprises of five principles, Ahimsa. Satya. Asteya. Brahmacharya. Aparigraha. The first principle Ahimsa. which means nonviolence. Satya. which means truthfulness. Asteya. which means nonstealing. Brahmacharya. which means continence. Aparigraha. which means noncovetousness. The second limb of Ashtanga is Niyama. which means Discipline. This niyamas also comprises of five principles, saucha. Santosh. Tapa. Svadhyaya. Ishvara Pranidhana. The first principle, Saucha. which means cleanliness. Samtosa. which means contentment. Tapas. which means heat and spiritual austerities. Svadhyaya. which means study of the sacred scriptures and of one's self. Isvara pranidhana. which means surrender to God. The third limb of Ashtanga is Asana. which means Physical exercises. Initially, There are 84 lakhs that means 8.4 million asanas as told by god Shiva. In early days, people use to live very long lives and use to practice so many asanas. But, later on, it became impossible to practice so many asanas in one’s life time. So, out of those 84 lakhs, only 84 were chosen which were very practical for a normal human being to practice. After some more time passed, 84 asanas were also considered too much. Later on, 32 asanas were selected out of those 84. These 32 asanas are extracts of all initial 84 lakh or 8.4 million asanas. The fourth limb of Ashtanga is Pranayama. which means Breath exercises. The fifth limb of Ashtanga is Pratyahara. which means withdrawal of the senses from external objects. Then comes the sixth limb of Ashtanga which is Dharana. means Concentration. The seventh limb of Ashtanga is Dhyana. which means Meditation. and the last limb that is the eighth limb of Ashtanga is Samadhi. which means Complete Realisation. These eight steps of Raja Yoga provide systematic instruction to attain inner peace, clarity, self-control and realisation.`,
     
     GYANAYOGA_MOREINFO :  `Gyana is Sanskrit for “knowledge or wisdom” and Gyana Yoga is the path of attaining knowledge of the true nature 
                           of reality through the practice of meditation, self-inquiry, and contemplation. Gyana Yoga can be defined as the 
                           “awareness of absolute consciousness,” and is a comprehensive practice of self-study which is called Svadhyaya. 
                           In Gyana yoga, the mind is used to inquire into its own nature and to transcend the mind’s identification with its 
                           thoughts and ego. The fundamental goal of Gyana yoga is to become liberated from the illusionary world of maya which 
                           means self-limiting thoughts and perceptions and to achieve the union of the inner Self, that is Atman with the oneness 
                           of all life, that is Brahman. This is achieved by steadfastly practicing the mental techniques of self-questioning, 
                           reflection and conscious illumination that are defined in the Four Pillars of Knowledge. Gyana Yoga utilizes a 
                           one-pointed meditation on a single question of self-inquiry to remove the veils of illusion created by your concepts, 
                           world views, and perceptions. This practice allows you to realize the temporary and illusionary nature of maya and to 
                           see the oneness of all things.  Gyana Yoga has four principles, Viveka. which means Discrimination. Vairagya. which 
                           means Renunciation. Shatsampatti. which means The Six Treasures. This Shatsampatti comprises of six principles, 
                           Shama. Dama. Uparati. Titiksha. Shraddha. Samadhana. and last one in Gyana yoga is Mumukshtva. which means Constant 
                           Striving for God.`,

    SAKAMAKARMA: `Karma comes from the root word “kama” which means, desires. Karma comes from the root word "kriya" which means, to do. Sakam Karma is to work with selfish expectations and your own interests in mind. We have to pay back all our Karmas in this life or in future lives, good or bad. It could be good Karma, but if it is selfish it is a chain that binds you. Good and bad, both Karmas will bind you and put us into bondage. Usually the negative Karma is harder, and the good Karmas are softer.`,

    NISHKAMAKARMA: `Karma comes from the root word “kama” which means, desires. Karma comes from the root word "kriya" which means, to do.Nishkam Karma on the other hand is working with selfless or unselfish motives. Nishkama Kharma frees us from the wheel of Death and Re-birth. It is the way to avoid creating new Kharma and may even resolve earlier Karmas. Everyone of us have to pay back all our Karmas in this life or in future lives, good or bad. It could be good Karma, but if it is selfish it is a chain that binds you. Nishkama Karma also still binds you to the Karmic law. Good and bad, both Karmas will bind you, put you into bondage. Usually the negative Karma is harder, and good Karmas are softer. Nishkama Karma means getting free from all types of desires and doing Seva which means selfless service, without the expectation of receiving acknowledgement, reward or a word of thanks.`,
    
    NISHKARMA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    APARABHAKTI: `Apara bhakti is one of two main forms of bhakti, or devotion to God, according to the Bhagavad Gita. The term is derived from Sanskrit with apara meaning “lower” or “inferior”; and the root word, bhaj, meaning “worship” or “revere.” Bhakti has several meanings in English, including “devotional service,” “faithfulness,” “piety” and “devotion.” In this sense, it is devotion as a means to salvation. Apara-Bhakti is for beginners in Yoga. The beginner decorates an image with flowers and garlands, rings the bell, offers Naivedya (food-offerings), wave lights; he observes rituals and ceremonies. The Bhakta here regards the Lord as a Supreme Person, who is immanent in that image and who can be propitiated through that form only. Most of people follow the, Apara Bhakti which is the easier path to salvation. It is in fact the starting point of Bhakti & on that account it is also called the premature stage of Bhakti.`,
    
    APARABHAKTI_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    PARABHAKTI: `Para bhakti is a Sanskrit term referring to devotion that transcends all worldly concerns and is pure, transparent and simple. It generally refers to devotion to the Divine, or God, and is a supreme state of love and respect. Para bhakti is considered pure, selfless and humble. Para bhakti is the highest form bhakti, where the devotee sees and worships God everywhere and experiences the Divine as manifested in the whole universe. They are able to express their love and devotion through every action and encounter in their lives. For example, Before you take your food, offer it to God mentally; and the food will be purified. When you pass through a garden of flowers, mentally offer all the flowers to the Lord in Archana (offering flowers in worship). When you pass through the bazaar and see a sweet shop, offer all the sweets as Naivedya to the Lord. Such practices will lead to Para-Bhakti. Para bhakti is considered the more advanced practice as it is more subtle and abstract to comprehend. As such, many devotee may begin with apara bhakti and then gradually progress to para bhakti. There may be a transitional period of several years where apara and para bhakti are both practiced, before the devotee moves fully into para bhakti.`,

    YAMA: `The first limb, yama, deals with one's ethical standards and sense of integrity, focusing on our behavior and how we conduct ourselves in life. Yamas are universal practices that relate best to what we know as the Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." The five yamas are, Ahimsa. nonviolence. Satya. truthfulness. Asteya. nonstealing. Brahmacharya. continence. Aparigraha. noncovetousness.`,
    
    YAMA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    NIYAMA: `Niyama, the second limb, has to do with self-discipline and spiritual observances. Regularly attending temple or church services, saying grace before meals, developing your own personal meditation practices, or making a habit of taking contemplative walks alone are all examples of niyamas in practice. The five yamas are, Saucha. cleanliness. Samtosa. contentment. Tapas. heat and spiritual austerities. Svadhyaya. study of the sacred scriptures and of one's self. Isvara pranidhana. surrender to God.`,
    
    NIYAMA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    ASANA: `Asanas, the postures practiced in yoga, comprise the third limb. In the yogic view, the body is a temple of spirit, the care of which is an important stage of our spiritual growth. Through the practice of asanas, we develop the habit of discipline and the ability to concentrate, both of which are necessary for meditation. Initially, There are 84 lakhs that means 8.4 million asanas as told by god Shiva. In early days, people use to live very long lives and use to practice so many asanas. But, later on, it became impossible to practice so many asanas in one’s life time. So, out of those 84 lakhs, only 84 were chosen which were very practical for a normal human being to practice. After some more time passed, 84 asanas were also considered too much. Later on, 32 asanas were selected out of those 84. These 32 asanas are extracts of all initial 84 lakh or 8.4 million asanas.`,
    
    ASANA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    PRANAYAM: `Generally translated as breath control, this fourth stage consists of techniques designed to gain mastery over the respiratory process while recognizing the connection between the breath, the mind, and the emotions. As implied by the literal translation of pranayama, "life force extension,". It not only rejuvenates the body but actually extends life itself. You can practice pranayama as an isolated technique that is, simply sitting and performing a number of breathing exercises, or integrate it into your daily hatha yoga routine. The yama, niyama, asana, pranayam stages of Patanjali's ashtanga yoga concentrate on refining our personalities, gaining mastery over the body, and developing an energetic awareness of ourselves, all of which prepares us for the second half of this journey, which deals with the senses, the mind, and attaining a higher state of consciousness.`,
    
    PRANAYAM_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    PRATYAHARA: `Pratyahara, the fifth limb, means withdrawal or sensory transcendence. It is during this stage that we make the conscious effort to draw our awareness away from the external world and outside stimuli. Keenly aware of, yet cultivating a detachment from, our senses, we direct our attention internally. The practice of pratyahara provides us with an opportunity to step back and take a look at ourselves. This withdrawal allows us to objectively observe our cravings: habits that are perhaps detrimental to our health and which likely interfere with our inner growth.`,
    
    PRATYAHARA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    DHARANA: `As each stage prepares us for the next, the practice of pratyahara which is fifth limb in astanga's creates the setting for dharana, or concentration. Having relieved ourselves of outside distractions, we can now deal with the distractions of the mind itself. In the practice of concentration, which precedes meditation, we learn how to slow down the thinking process by concentrating on a single mental object that is a specific energetic center in the body, an image of a deity, or the silent repetition of a sound. We, of course, have already begun to develop our powers of concentration in the previous three stages of posture, breath control, and withdrawal of the senses. In asana and pranayama, although we pay attention to our actions, our attention travels. Our focus constantly shifts as we fine-tune the many nuances of any particular posture or breathing technique. In pratyahara we become self-observant; now, in dharana, we focus our attention on a single point. Extended periods of concentration naturally lead to meditation.`,
    
    DHARANA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    DHYANA: `Dhyana means Meditation or contemplation, this is the seventh stage of ashtanga. Dhyana is the uninterrupted flow of concentration. Although concentration which means dharana and meditation which means dhyana may appear to be one and the same, a fine line of distinction exists between these two stages. Where dharana practices one-pointed attention, dhyana is ultimately a state of being keenly aware without focus. At this stage, our mind has been quieted, and in the stillness it produces few or no thoughts at all. It takes a lot of strength and stamina to reach this state of stillness.`,
    
    DHYANA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    SAMADHI: `Patanjali describes this eighth and final stage of ashtanga, samadhi, as a state of ecstasy. At this stage, the meditator merges with his or her point of focus and transcends the Self altogether. The meditator comes to realize a profound connection to the Divine, an interconnectedness with all living things. With this realization comes the "peace that passeth all understanding"; the experience of bliss and being at one with the Universe. On the surface, this may seem to be a rather lofty, "holier than thou" kind of goal. However, if we pause to examine what we really want to get out of life, would not joy, fulfillment, and freedom somehow find their way onto our list of hopes, wishes, and desires? Patanjali has described as the completion of the yogic path is what, deep down, all human beings aspire to, peace. We also might give some thought to the fact that this ultimate stage of yoga—enlightenment—can neither be bought nor possessed. It can only be experienced, the price of which is the continual devotion of the aspirant.`,
    
    SAMADHI_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    VIVEKA: `Viveka is the purest form of knowledge. It can also be described as the supreme authority of our conscience. Our conscience tells us what is right and what is wrong. Mostly we know very well what we should do, however, our egoistic desires generally show themselves as stronger and drown the voice of conscience within us.`,
    
    VIVEKA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    VAIRAGYA: `Vairagya means to liberate oneself inwardly from any desire for earthly pleasure or possessions. A Gyana Yogi has realised that all worldly pleasures are unreal and are therefore without lasting value. A Gyana Yogi seeks the unchanging, the eternal Supreme, God. All things of this earthly realm are transitory and therefore a form of unreality. Reality is the Atma, the Divine Self, which is indestructible, eternal and unchanging. The Atma is comparable to space. Space is always space, one cannot burn it or cut it. If we put up walls we create single “individual” compartments. How-ever, space does not change itself because of this, and one day when the walls are removed, there only remains undivided, endless space.`,
    
    VAIRAGYA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    SHATSAMPATTI: `Shat-Sampathi is a the sixfold virtue or six mental practices to stabilize the mind. It consists of Shama. Dama. Uparati. Titiksha. Shraddha. and, Samadhana. All these six qualities are mental practices to stabilize the mind to control and discipline the mind, without which concentration and meditation are impossible.`,
    
    SHATSAMPATTI_REPROMPT: ` `,
   
    MUMUKSHTVA: `Mumukshtva is the burning desire in the heart to realise God and unite with God. The Supreme and Eternal Knowledge is Atma Gyana, the Realisation of our true Self. Self-Realisation is the experience that we are not separate from God, but are one with God and all of life. When this Realisation dawns, the boundaries of the intellect are opened and absolute. All encompassing love fills our heart. It also becomes clear that whatever harms others, ultimately harms us. So finally we understand and obey the Universal precept of Ahimsa, non-violence. In this way the path of Gyana Yoga unites with the principles of Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga and Raja Yoga.`,

    AHIMSA: `In Sanskrit the prefix a means. “not”. while himsa means. “harming, injuring, killing, or doing violence.” So, Ahimsa means non-harming or non-violence. It is first of the yamas and the highest importance among them. Ahimsa is the key, to maintaining both harmonious relationships in the world and a tranquil inner life. At a deeper level, ahimsa is less a conscious process than a natural consequence of yoga practice. As our journey unfolds, it leads to awareness of the peaceful and enduring core that is our true nature; the desire to prevent harm is a spontaneous expression of that awareness. We begin to realize that the inner self in others is identical to our own inner self, and we wish no harm to come to any being.`,
    
    AHIMSA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    SATYA: `Patanjali lists satya, or truth, as the next yama. In Sanskrit, sat. means the eternal, unchanging truth beyond all knowing. ya. is the activating suffix which means. "do it." So, satya means "actively expressing and being in harmony with the ultimate truth." In this state we cannot lie or act untruthful, because we are unified with pure truth itself. So, telling the truth mean speaking with the intention of being truthful. Another aspect of satya is, inner truth or integrity. a deeper and more internal practice. Honesty is what we do when others are around and might judge our actions or words, but to have integrity is to act in an honest manner when others are not around and will never know about our actions.`,
    
    SATYA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    ASTEYA: `The word steya means “stealing”. When it is combined with the prefix A. it yields the third yama, Asteya. non-stealing. While commonly understood as not taking what is not ours, it can also mean not taking more than we need. Asteya arises from the Vritti which means different thoughts or fluctuations of the mind. We are most likely to associate stealing with tangible objects, but intangibles, such as information and emotional favors, are more likely to be the objects stolen in our world. We usually fails to practice asteya when we take credit that is not ours or take more food than we can eat. We also fails when we steal from ourselves by neglecting a talent, or by letting a lack of commitment keep us from practicing yoga.`,
    
    ASTEYA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    BRAHMACHARYA: `The fourth yama is brahmacharya, The classical translation is "celibacy," but Brahma. is the name of a deity. char. means "to walk". and ya. means "actively". so brahmacharya means. "walking with God." For some people, sexual love holds no great attraction. Others sacrifice this part of life to live as a monk or nun and thus consecrate their sexuality to God. Brahmacharya does not just mean giving up sex; it also means to transmute the energy of sex into something else, principally, devotion to God. But for the average person who has taken up the study of yoga, brahmacharya might mean simply to remain faithful within a monogamous relationship. Another approach is to use sexual energy, like all life energies, in accord with the practice of ahimsa. This means that we respect ourselves and our partner when we are in a sexual relationship and do not use others or have sex mindlessly. Remembering the divinity of self and other, we can allow sexuality to be part of the wider practice of yoga.`,
    
    BRAHMACHARYA_REPROMPT: ``,
    
    APARIGRAHA: `Aparigraha is the last among all the yamas. In Aparigraha, Graha means. “to grasp” and Pari means. “things”. So, Aparigraha means. ‘non-greed’, ‘non-possessiveness’, and ‘non-attachment’. This important Yama teaches us to take only what we need, keep only what serves us at the moment and to let go when the time is right.  The essence of aparigraha is, All the things of the world are yours to use, but not to own. It helps us achieve a balanced relationship with the things that we each call “mine”. Whenever we become possessive, we are in turn possessed, anxiously holding onto our things and grasping for more. But when we make good use of the possessions that come to us and enjoy them without becoming emotionally dependent on them, then they neither wield power over us nor lead to false identities and expectations.`,

    SAUCHA: `Saucha is the first Niyama according to Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras. This Niyama includes several practices for cleansing the body and mind. In fact, many yogis describe Saucha as the “aim of the whole yoga system.” The impurities found both in our internal bodies, and the external environment can affect the state of our minds negatively. As a result, our minds can be unable to attain spiritual liberation and the real wisdom. However, practicing pranayama, meditation, and asana can help in purifying and cleansing the mind and body. Also, it can strengthen the capacity of the mind and body to uphold a clean state of being. Saucha also encourages us to surround ourselves with a clean environment. This includes drinks, food, friends, home furnishings, transportation, and entertainment. This means we should prevent external impurities from getting into our minds and bodies. According to the sages, Suacha is the foundation of bodily health, and it opens the door to a tranquil and deeper state of meditation.`,

    SANTOSH: `Santosha is defined as “contentment” or “joy, happiness, or delight.” This Niyama teaches us not to crave for what we don’t possess, and not to covet what other people have. Santosha comes from experiencing acceptance. That is accepting life, ourselves, and what life brings to our lives. Contentment brings happiness. When you are content with what life gives you, then you will be able to attain true happiness and joy. And this is the true key to santosha. This Niyama brings the gratification of contentment—which makes happiness our choice. Our minds can easily be fooled to think that long-lasting happiness can come from possessing goods and objects. However, the personal experience teach us that the happiness gained by possessing materials is short-lived. Practicing contentment sets us free from the needless suffering of desiring things in your life to be different. Instead, it fills our lives with joy and gratitude for the blessings we already possess.`,

    TAPA: `The meaning of this Tapa niyama is "heat." This heat usually builds up through times of resolute effort. Tapas requires us to practice intense self-discipline and achieve willpower. Self-discipline is doing something that you don’t want to, but it has a positive impact on your life. Tapas accompany the disciplines that are gladly and willingly accepted for them to bring an absolute change in our lives. This can be new habits, improved healthy living, different direction of life, or better concentration. When the desires of our minds conflict with our wills, this causes an internal fire, which burns and illuminates our physical and mental impurities. The inner fire that is created becomes a foundation of spiritual energy. Practicing tapas causes the discharge of kundalini as well as attaining enlightenment. The good thing about tapas is that it purifies and transforms us. Besides, enables us to control our poor behavior and unconscious impulses, and improve our mental health. Tapas creates passion, increases confidence and strength, and focuses energy. This assists us to become more committed to practicing yoga. Tapas will continuously remind you of your goals and will push you towards achieving it. It removes the negativity in you though detaching you from the unnecessary things in life. In addition, it keeps you away from things like procrastination, unpunctuality, laziness, and distraction.`,

    SVADHYAYA: `It gives us the ability to realize who truly we are. Through svadhyaya, we are able to see and understand our true nature through contemplating the lessons we learn from our lives as well as meditating on the truths that were revealed to us by the sages and seers. Svadhyaya gives us an infinite chance to learn about our weaknesses and flaws and assists us to correct them and move beyond them. Examining our deeds helps us to understand our desires, motives, and thoughts more clearly. This includes the things we do either consciously or unconsciously. Doing that assists you to understand your mistakes, and helps us to address these mistakes in a composed manner. The yogic practice of svadhyaya involves studying spiritual and sacred texts. These texts direct us to our inner world and this where we can find our true self. Understanding ourselves is more than analyzing and observing ourselves now. It also requires seeing past our present state in order to understand our connection with God. According to the sages, the greatest wisdom that we can ever possess is to know ourself. This helps us to understand what we need to do for improving ourself.`,

    ISHVARAPRANIDHANA: `This is devotion, surrender, and dedication to higher or divine power. Ishvara Pranidhana assists us to drop our ego, and helps us to understand how we can benefit from the things we do. According to Patanjali, we must drop our ego and the endless identification with ourselves if we want to achieve yoga goal. To achieve this, we should consider our yoga practice as well as all the benefits that we might receive from our yoga practice as an offering to a higher being. By dedicating ourselves to yoga practice, we get reminded of our connection to a divine being. This makes our yoga practice to become “sacred.” In addition, we are filled with inner peace, abounding love, and grace. However, this will only happen when we drop our selfishness and start surrendering to god.`,
    
    ISHVARAPRANIDHANA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    SHAMA: `Shama is serenity or tranquillity of mind that is brought about by eradication of vasanas, inherent desires. The mind is kept in the chambers of the heart. It is not allowed to join with the indriyas, senses, and to move outside into sensual objects or grooves. The mind is fixed on the source. Serenity of mind is the most important qualification for an aspirant. This is difficult to attain. But the aspirant must have this qualification at any cost. It demands incessant and protracted practice. The mind is the commander of the ten sense organs, five organs of perception and five organs of action. If the commander is subjugated first of all, the soldiers, that is, the senses, are already conquered. Control of the senses cannot become perfect unless the mind is controlled first. If one is established in shama, dama or control of the senses comes by itself. No sense organ can work independently without the help or cooperation of the mind.`,
    
    SHAMA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    DAMA: `Dama is control of the senses. This is rational control. This is not blunting or deadening of the senses by foolish austerities. The body is the moving temple of God. It should be kept healthy and strong. It is a vessel to take you to the other shore of fearlessness and immortality. If the mind is subdued, then attempts to be centred in brahmacharya will be failed. Judicious control of the senses is required. The senses should be consecrated at the lotus-feet of the Lord for his services. If the senses are disciplined properly, if they are kept under control, they become our useful servants. The necessity for the practice of dama is, when one practices shama. Dama or control of the senses is also necessary. Then only one will get supreme control of mind and the senses. Though the senses cannot independently play any havoc when the mind is under control, yet their control ensures perfect safety and supreme peace of mind.`,
    
    DAMA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    UPARATI: `Uparati comes next. It is satiety. It is turning the mind resolutely away from desire for sexual enjoyment. This state of mind naturally comes when one has practised viveka, vairagya, shama and dama. Uparati is the abstaining on principle from engaging in any of the acts and ceremonies enjoined by the scriptures. Otherwise, it is the state of mind which is always engaged in shravana, hearing of shrutis, manana, reflection, and nididhyasana, meditation on Brahman, without ever diverging from them. Some perceive uparati as taking up sannyasa by renouncing all works.`,
    
    UPARATI_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    TITIKSHA: `Titiksha is power of endurance. The aspirant should patiently bear the pairs of opposites such as heat and cold, pleasure and pain and the rest. The bearing of all afflictions without caring to redress them, being free at the same time from anxiety or lament on their score is called titiksha or forbearance. One who practise terrific austerities not enjoined by the scriptures, given to hypocrisy and egoism, impelled by the force of lust and attachment, senseless, torturing all the elements in the body and Me also, who dwells in the body – know thou these to be of demoniacal resolves. Some make titiksha as the end. Titiksha is only a means. Wherever there is movement, wherever there is manifestation of life, the two opposed forces, the pairs of opposites, do exist. Some ignorants, desire to get rid of the unpleasant experiences and to keep only the pleasant ones. This is the height of folly. Can there be light alone without darkness, roses alone without thorns, gain alone without loss, success alone without failure, victory alone without defeat, pleasure alone without pain? A wise people who rightly understands them and moves in close cooperation with them can be happy, not others. A wise people never grumbles. They tries to fix themselves up in that unchanging, permanent, witnessing consciousness which is hidden in his heart, which is beyond all the pairs of opposites, and then watches the movements and the phenomena of this universe with an unruffled mind. They sees intelligence in every inch of creation. They have a very comprehensive understanding of the eternal laws of nature and the pairs of opposites. This is true titiksha based on knowledge. They are superior to physical titikshus, those who practise only physical endurance, who will show signs of failure when confronted by serious disasters. A titikshu who has developed his titiksha through knowledge is the king of all titikshus.`,
    
    TITIKSHA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    SHRADDHA: `Shraddha is intense faith in the words of the guru and in the sayings of the vedantic scriptures and, above all, in one’s own self. This is not blind faith. It is based on accurate reasoning, evidence and experience. Then only it can be lasting faith. Then only it can be perfect, unshakeable faith. Superstitious beliefs, beliefs in mere religious traditions or social customs cannot help one in spiritual advancement. The mind will be ever restless. Various doubts will crop up every now and then. Sectarians force their beliefs on others, try to convert them and take them in their fold to strengthen their numbers. The new convert does not find real solace in the newly-embraced cult. He then embraces yet another cult. Shraddha is the most important qualification. No spiritual progress is possible without shraddha. From shraddha comes nistha or one-pointed devotion and from nistha comes self-realization. If the faith is flickering, it will die soon and the aspirant will be drifted aimlessly.`,
    
    SHRADDHA_REPROMPT: ` `,
    
    SAMADHANA: `Samadhana is mental balance by attention. This is the fruit of the practices of shama, dama, uparati, titiksha and shraddha. There is prefect concentration now. It is fixing the mind on the atman without allowing it to turn towards objects and have its own way. It is self-settledness. Whenever a mind engaged in shravana, manana and nididhasana wanders to any worldly object or desire, and finding it worthless, returns to the performance of the three exercises, such returning is called samadhana. The mind is free from anxiety amid pains. There is indifference amid pleasures. There is stability of mind or mental poise. The aspirant or practitioner is on every side without attachment. He neither likes nor dislikes. He has great deal of strength of mind and internal peace. He has unruffled, supreme peace of mind. Some aspirants have peace of mind when they live in seclusion and when there are no distracting elements. They complain of great tossing of mind or vikshepa when they come to a city and mix with people. They are completely upset. They cannot do any meditation in a crowded place. This is a weakness. This is not achievement in samadhana. There is no balance of mind or equanimity in these persons. Only when a student can keep his balance of mind even in a battlefield when there is a shower of bullets all around, as he does in a solitary cave in the Himalayas, can he be really said to be fully established in samadhana. The disciplined self, moving among sense-objects with senses free from attraction and repulsion mastered by the self, goes to peace. This is called samadhana.`,
